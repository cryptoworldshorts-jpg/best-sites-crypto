      <h2>What Is FTMO and How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO is a proprietary trading firm that provides traders with funded accounts after they complete a performance-based evaluation. Instead of risking your own capital, FTMO allows you to prove your strategy in their Challenge and Verification stages. If you show consistent risk management and hit the profit targets, you receive a funded account with real payouts. This model has changed the industry completely, giving thousands of traders worldwide the chance to earn from the markets without needing large savings.
      </p>

      <h3>The FTMO Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        The Challenge is the first phase of the evaluation. Traders must achieve a profit target while following rules such as maximum daily loss and maximum total loss. These rules are designed to protect traders from overleveraging and emotional decisions. The goal is not just to profit but to demonstrate discipline, consistency, and risk awareness — the same qualities required by professional hedge funds.
      </p>

      <h3>Verification Stage</h3>
      <p>
        After passing the Challenge, traders enter the Verification phase. This step has a lower profit target and the same risk limits, making it easier to complete. FTMO uses this stage to confirm that the trader’s first stage wasn’t luck. Once completed, you become an official FTMO Funded Trader.
      </p>

      <h3>Payouts and Profit Split</h3>
      <p>
        As a funded trader, you can receive payouts every 14 or 30 days depending on your preference. The profit split can reach <strong>90%</strong>, which is one of the highest in the prop firm industry. FTMO pays out millions every year and is known for transparency and reliability, making it a popular choice for serious traders.
      </p>

      <h3>Why FTMO Is the Best Prop Firm in 2025</h3>
      <p>
        Many new prop firms appear every year, but FTMO remains number one for several reasons: strong long-term reputation, strict but fair rules, realistic targets, fast payouts, and excellent customer support. While other firms change rules frequently, FTMO keeps everything stable, making it safer for traders relying on consistent income. Their technology, dashboard, and account metrics are also among the best in the industry.
      </p>

      <h3>Who Should Try FTMO?</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO is ideal for disciplined traders who already understand risk management and want to grow. If you trade forex, gold, indices, or crypto with a structured strategy, this program can dramatically scale your results. Even part-time traders can succeed because FTMO does not force unrealistic trading frequency. You can trade calmly and wait for clean setups.
