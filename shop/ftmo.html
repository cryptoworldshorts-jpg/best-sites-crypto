      <!-- ===================== NEW LONG SECTION ===================== -->
      <h2 id="ftmo-1-step">FTMO Challenge: 1-Step (2026) — Full Overview</h2>

      <p>
        FTMO launched a new evaluation format called <strong>FTMO Challenge: 1-Step</strong>. The purpose is to simplify the evaluation journey by using a single evaluation phase,
        while still enforcing strict risk objectives and a consistency framework.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are already a disciplined trader, 1-Step can feel more straightforward because you have fewer phases to “repeat.”
        If your style relies on high volatility days or large intraday swings, the model can be harder, because the daily risk cap and the trailing max loss are central to how the account is assessed.
      </p>

        <strong>Always verify:</strong> Trading Objectives can change. Before buying, confirm the latest 1-Step objectives and definitions on FTMO’s official pages (Best Day, daily reset time, and EOD trailing logic). 
      </p>

      <h3>Best Day Rule (how FTMO describes it)</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO defines the Best Day as the single day with the highest profit calculated from <strong>closed trades</strong>.
        If your Best Day is above half of your total profit, FTMO states it is <strong>not treated as a rule breach</strong>.
        Instead, you continue trading and build more profit so the Best Day becomes half or less of the total.
      </p>

      <h3>Why 1-Step can be easier (and why it can be harder)</h3>
      <p>
        1-Step can be easier if you already trade low-risk and you don’t like multi-phase evaluations.
        It can be harder if you trade aggressively, because the daily loss boundary and EOD trailing maximum loss can punish large swings and big givebacks after a green day.
      </p>

      <h3>Simple risk plan (practical)</h3>
      <p>
        Most evaluation failures happen from a few avoidable mistakes: revenge trading, increasing size after a loss, or holding too much exposure during volatile sessions.
        If you want to increase your odds, keep position sizing stable and define a personal daily stop that is smaller than the platform limit.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO is one of the most popular modern prop trading firms, known for its evaluation process that lets traders prove their skills and access larger funded accounts.
        In this FTMO review, the goal is to explain how the evaluation works, what rules you must follow and whether the program fits your trading style and risk tolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of risking only your own capital, you trade an FTMO evaluation account under risk management rules, and if you pass you can become eligible for payouts based on the firm’s model.
        This structure has attracted many traders worldwide who want to scale up without depositing large sums into a personal trading account.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is FTMO and How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO is a prop trading firm that offers traders the chance to trade a structured evaluation under clear objectives.
        You typically start on a simulated account during the evaluation where you must hit a profit target while staying within daily loss and overall loss limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traders who successfully meet the objectives can proceed to the next steps and access the FTMO account environment, where rewards are based on results and compliance.
        For many traders, FTMO acts as a bridge between trading a small personal account and handling a much larger balance under professional conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>FTMO Challenge, Profit Target &amp; Loss Limits</h2>
      <p>
        The evaluation is built around two things: hitting the profit objective and respecting the risk limits.
        The daily loss rule forces disciplined risk management, while the maximum loss limit keeps drawdowns controlled over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        To pass consistently, traders usually focus on stable execution over “home-run” trades.
        Following a plan, avoiding emotional overtrading and respecting the loss limits on every position are critical.
      </p>

      <h2>Platforms, Accounts &amp; Flexibility</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO supports multiple trading platforms and a wide range of instruments (depending on platform).
        Different account sizes and configurations are available, so you can choose an evaluation that matches your comfort level.
      </p>

      <h2>Educational Tools &amp; Risk Support</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO is known for performance analytics and educational resources that help traders identify strengths and weaknesses.
        Reviewing metrics, drawdowns, and execution patterns can make it easier to refine risk management.
      </p>

      <h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>
      <p>
        Pros include structured rules, transparency, and a model that can help disciplined traders scale.
        Cons include strict limits that can feel stressful if your strategy naturally has higher volatility.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Increase Your Chances</h2>
      <p>
        Treat the evaluation like a professional process: keep position size consistent, avoid revenge trading, and reduce risk after strong winning days.
        Many successful traders focus on fewer, higher-quality setups rather than overtrading.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ftmo-faq">FTMO FAQ (Updated)</h2>

      <h3>What is FTMO Challenge: 1-Step?</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO Challenge: 1-Step is a single-phase evaluation format. It includes a profit target, a maximum daily loss limit, a maximum loss limit using EOD trailing updates, and a Best Day consistency objective. Always confirm the newest objectives on FTMO’s official pages.
      </p>

      <h3>How does the Best Day Rule work?</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO states the Best Day is calculated from closed trades. If your best day temporarily represents more than half of your total profit, it is not treated as a breach; you continue trading until total profit increases enough for the ratio to fall to half or less.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I fail even if I’m profitable?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. You can be profitable overall but fail if you breach daily loss or maximum loss limits at any time.
      </p>
