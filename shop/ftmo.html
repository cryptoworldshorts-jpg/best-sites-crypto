      <!-- ===================== NEW SECTION (LONG) ===================== -->
      <h2 id="ftmo-1-step">FTMO 1-Step Challenge (2026 Update): What Changed</h2>

      <p>
        FTMO introduced a new evaluation format called <strong>FTMO Challenge: 1-Step</strong>, designed for traders who want a simpler path than the classic multi-phase structure.
        The main idea is a single evaluation phase with objectives focused on risk control, consistency, and sustainable trading rather than rushing a target.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, the 1-Step format changes how you should pace your trading.
        Instead of trying to “finish fast,” many traders will benefit from trading smaller, avoiding unnecessary sessions, and treating each day as a separate risk budget.
      </p>

      <p style="background: rgba(0, 234, 255, 0.08); padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #00eaff;">
        <strong>Quick facts (verify on FTMO before purchase):</strong><br />
        • Single evaluation phase (no separate Verification).<br />
        • Reward model designed to start at a top profit share level from the first reward.<br />
        • No time limits for reaching the profit target.<br />
        • Daily loss is recalculated each new trading day.<br />
        • Maximum loss uses an End-of-Day trailing mechanism (updated once per day after market close).<br />
        • Best Day Rule is a consistency objective (temporary excess is not treated as a breach; you can continue trading to resolve it).<br />
      </p>

      <h3>How 1-Step works (plain English)</h3>
      <p>
        The 1-Step model is still an evaluation: you trade under defined objectives, and the account is monitored to ensure you respect risk limits.
        The difference is the structure is designed to be more direct, and a big part of the framework is learning to protect equity day after day.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your strategy is already disciplined, this may feel simpler.
        If you rely on high leverage or large intraday swings, it can be harder, because the model encourages stable “low-drama” execution.
      </p>

      <h3>Maximum Daily Loss: why traders fail it</h3>
      <p>
        A daily loss rule is not just “don’t lose too much.”
        The real danger is a combination of overtrading, increasing size after a loss, and holding positions through sudden volatility.
      </p>

      <p>
        A practical approach is to define your own personal daily stop (smaller than the platform limit) and stop trading after you hit it.
        Doing that protects you from emotional decisions and helps keep your evaluation smooth.
      </p>

      <h3>End-of-Day trailing Maximum Loss: what it teaches</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO describes the 1-Step maximum loss as a boundary derived from the highest balance reached at the end of a trading day, not from intraday fluctuations.
        The core lesson is that keeping profits matters: a strong day should not be followed by large givebacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many traders adapt by lowering risk after green days and focusing on consistency.
        That approach also helps with the “Best Day” consistency logic because it avoids a single “hero day” dominating your results.
      </p>

      <h3>Best Day Rule: how to trade around it</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO introduced a Best Day consistency rule to encourage stable results over multiple days.
        The key point FTMO highlights is that if you temporarily exceed the Best Day threshold, it is not treated as a breach and can be resolved by continuing to trade and increasing total profit so the proportion drops.
      </p>

      <p>
        Practically, this often means: if you have a big early win, don’t just stop and celebrate.
        You may need a few extra smaller profitable days to “balance out” the curve and satisfy the objective.
      </p>

      <h3>1-Step vs 2-Step: which one is better?</h3>
      <p>
        1-Step is designed for traders who prefer a more direct evaluation structure and want fewer phases.
        2-Step may still be a good fit if you prefer the classic path and you’re comfortable with a multi-phase process.
      </p>

      <p style="background: rgba(255, 204, 0, 0.08); padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #ffcc00;">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Trading objectives can change. Always confirm the current rules and objectives on the official FTMO website before buying any challenge.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO is one of the most popular modern prop trading firms, known for its evaluation process that lets traders prove their skills and access larger funded accounts.
        In this FTMO review 2025, the goal is to explain how the FTMO Challenge works, what rules you must follow and whether the program fits your trading style and risk tolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of risking only your own capital, you trade an FTMO account under strict risk management rules, and if you pass the evaluation you can become a funded trader with profit share payouts.
        This model has attracted thousands of FTMO traders worldwide who want to scale up without depositing large sums into a personal trading account.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is FTMO and How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO is a prop trading firm that offers traders the chance to manage company capital after completing a two-step evaluation process.
        You start on a demo account during the FTMO Challenge phase, where you must hit a profit target while staying within daily loss and overall loss limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you pass the FTMO Challenge, you move to the Verification phase with a lower profit target but the same focus on consistent risk management.
        Traders who successfully complete both steps can qualify for live funded accounts, where they trade with firm capital and receive a profit share from their results.
      </p>
      <p>
        For many traders, FTMO acts as a bridge between trading a small personal account and handling a much larger balance under professional conditions.
        You pay a one-time fee to enter the evaluation and, if you pass, you can trade an FTMO account many times larger than what you might comfortably deposit on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        This structure aligns incentives: FTMO looks for traders who can follow rules and protect capital, while traders get access to funded accounts and a profit share without taking on full downside risk.
        It is still real trading with real consequences for bad risk management, but without the psychological pressure of losing your own savings.
      </p>

      <h2>FTMO Challenge, Profit Target &amp; Loss Limits</h2>
      <p>
        The FTMO Challenge is the first step of the evaluation process where you trade a demo account under real market conditions.
        Your goal is to reach a predefined profit target within a set number of trading days while respecting strict daily loss and overall loss limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The daily loss rule prevents you from losing more than a fixed percentage of the FTMO account in a single day, which forces disciplined risk management.
        The maximum loss limit ensures that even over multiple days you cannot allow large drawdowns, rewarding traders who keep position sizes and stop-loss levels under control.
      </p>
      <p>
        To pass FTMO challenges consistently, traders usually focus on building a trading style that emphasizes stable execution over home-run trades.
        Following a clear plan, avoiding emotional revenge trading and respecting the loss limits on every position are critical if you want to progress to a funded account.
      </p>

      <h2>Platforms, FTMO Accounts &amp; Trading Style Flexibility</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO accounts can be traded on popular platforms such as MT5, cTrader and DXtrade, giving you a familiar environment if you already use these tools.
        You can choose different account sizes and a standard account structure that matches how much capital you want to eventually manage if you become a funded trader.
      </p>
      <p>
        The firm allows a variety of trading styles as long as you respect the rules, so day traders, swing traders and even some news traders can find a way to fit their approach into the framework.
        This flexibility is one reason many traders view FTMO as a modern prop trading alternative to traditional proprietary trading desks.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of FTMO Accounts &amp; Profit Share</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO offers different starting account sizes so traders can choose an evaluation that matches their ambitions and comfort level.
        Larger accounts usually come with higher potential payouts, but the daily loss and overall loss limits are also expressed as bigger monetary values, which can test your discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you become a funded trader, you receive a profit share from the gains generated on your FTMO accounts, while the firm absorbs trading losses within the agreed limits.
        This means your primary job is to protect equity, stay within the rules and steadily grow the account rather than chase oversized returns in a short time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, consistently profitable FTMO traders may qualify for account scaling, where the size of their funded accounts can increase if they meet performance criteria.
        This creates a pathway where disciplined traders can gradually manage more capital without taking on additional personal financial risk.
      </p>

      <h2>Educational Tools, Performance Coaches &amp; Risk Management</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond funding, FTMO supports traders with educational tools, statistics dashboards and performance coaches who help you understand strengths and weaknesses in your approach.
        You can review detailed metrics on your trades, including average win and loss, drawdown and preferred trading hours, which makes it easier to refine risk management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access to performance coaches is particularly valuable for traders who struggle with psychology, discipline or adapting their trading style to the firm’s rules.
        By combining structured feedback with clear loss limits, FTMO encourages traders to build habits that are sustainable over the long term, not just during the evaluation process.
      </p>

      <h2>Pros &amp; Cons of FTMO in 2025</h2>
      <p>
        As a prop trading firm, FTMO offers the opportunity to trade larger funded accounts without putting all your own capital at risk, which is a major advantage for skilled but undercapitalized traders.
        The transparent rules around daily loss, profit target and maximum drawdown also make it clear what is expected before you start the evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, some traders find the strict loss limits stressful, especially if their natural trading style involves higher volatility or larger swings.
        Passing the FTMO Challenge requires consistency and emotional control, so it may not be suitable for traders who have not yet developed a robust risk management framework.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Increase Your Chances to Pass the FTMO Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The traders who pass FTMO challenges most often are usually those who treat the evaluation like a professional job rather than a quick gamble.
        They start with a clearly defined trading style, stick to a written plan and size positions so that even a string of losing trades will not violate the daily loss or maximum loss limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many successful candidates take time to practice on a personal demo account before paying for the evaluation, using this phase to refine entries, exits and risk per trade.
        By the time they start the FTMO Challenge, they already know their typical drawdown, win rate and average trade, which makes it easier to stay calm during inevitable losing streaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another useful approach is to focus on quality over quantity by taking fewer, higher-probability trades instead of trying to hit the profit target through overtrading.
        Combining conservative position sizing with patience can make it more realistic to reach the profit target while staying comfortably inside the daily loss boundaries.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts: Who Should Try FTMO in 2025?</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO is best suited to disciplined traders who already have a tested strategy and want to scale up through funded accounts rather than trading only personal capital.
        If you are comfortable working within defined loss limits, tracking performance and adjusting your trading style to fit clear rules, the FTMO Challenge can be a realistic path to becoming a funded trader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traders who are still experimenting or rely heavily on impulsive decisions may struggle with the evaluation process and should first focus on developing consistency on their own demo account.
        For serious and methodical FTMO traders, however, this modern prop trading model can offer a structured way to access more capital and share in the profits of successful trading.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, FTMO is not a shortcut to easy money but a structured way to prove that you can trade responsibly under clear rules.
        If you already have a solid edge and are willing to treat the evaluation process with the same seriousness as a professional trading job, FTMO in 2025 can be a worthwhile opportunity to access institutional-sized capital.

      <h2 id="ftmo-faq">FTMO FAQ 2025/2026</h2>

      <h3>What is FTMO Challenge: 1-Step?</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO Challenge: 1-Step is a single-phase evaluation format designed as a more direct path than the classic multi-phase model. It includes a profit target, daily loss control, an end-of-day trailing maximum loss mechanism, and a Best Day consistency objective. Always verify current objectives on the official FTMO website.
      </p>

      <h3>How much capital can I manage with FTMO?</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO evaluation accounts typically range up to $200,000 for a single account, with the possibility of scaling and combining accounts over time if you trade consistently and respect the rules. Exact sizes and configurations can change, so it is always best to check the latest options on the official FTMO website.
      </p>

      <h3>How long does it take to pass the FTMO Challenge?</h3>
      <p>
        The FTMO evaluation can take different amounts of time depending on your strategy and risk management. Many traders focus more on quality trades than speed.
      </p>

      <h3>What are the main FTMO rules I need to follow?</h3>
      <p>
        The core rules revolve around maximum daily loss, overall maximum loss and reaching a profit target without breaking those limits. Violating risk rules usually means failing the evaluation, even if you were close to the profit target.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I trade forex, indices and crypto with FTMO?</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO offers access to multiple instrument categories depending on platform and account configuration. Always check the current instrument list and conditions on FTMO.
      </p>

      <h3>Is FTMO suitable for beginners?</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO is usually better suited to traders who already have a tested strategy and some live or demo experience. Beginners often struggle with the pressure of loss limits and targets.
      </p>

      <h3>How are payouts and profit splits handled?</h3>
      <p>
        Once you are funded, FTMO pays out your share of profits according to their current structure. Always confirm the latest payout terms in FTMO documentation.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I fail FTMO even if I am profitable?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. You can be profitable overall but still fail if you breach daily loss or maximum loss limits at any moment.
