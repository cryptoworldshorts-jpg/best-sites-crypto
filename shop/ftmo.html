      <!-- ===================== NEW LONG 1-STEP SECTION ===================== -->
      <h2 id="ftmo-1-step">FTMO Challenge: 1-Step (2026 Update) — Detailed Guide</h2>

      <p>
        FTMO has introduced a new evaluation product called <strong>FTMO Challenge: 1-Step</strong>. The headline change is that the evaluation is simplified into a single phase instead of a multi-phase pathway. The goal is efficiency — but the evaluation still focuses on strict risk control and consistency.
      </p>

      <p>
        This matters for traders because the evaluation model influences behaviour. A structure with strong daily risk boundaries and a trailing maximum loss model encourages stable position sizing, fewer impulsive sessions, and less “all-in” thinking. If your method already prioritizes discipline, the 1-Step approach can feel natural.
      </p>

        <strong>Important:</strong> Always confirm the newest Trading Objectives on FTMO’s official pages before buying. Definitions, reset times, and rule details can be updated. The Best Day Rule is described by FTMO as not being a breach if exceeded; you continue trading to satisfy it. 
      </p>

      <h3>What the 1-Step structure changes (mindset and pacing)</h3>
      <p>
        The biggest behavioural change is pacing. When a product has no time pressure, traders often perform better because they stop forcing trades. Instead of “I must hit target this week,” the better plan becomes “I trade only A+ setups, and I protect daily risk first.”
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re building an evaluation plan, a simple way to reduce mistakes is to trade fewer sessions and avoid the times of day where you historically make impulsive decisions. Many traders do best with a narrow routine: a single session, a limited number of attempts, and strict stops.
      </p>

      <h3>Maximum Daily Loss: the real reason traders break it</h3>
      <p>
        Most daily-loss failures happen after a small loss, not after a big win. The usual chain is: loss → frustration → larger size → second loss → panic → “one more trade” → breach. The way to break the chain is to set a personal daily stop that is smaller than the platform limit and obey it like a hard rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also keep in mind that daily loss rules are typically sensitive to open positions and floating PnL in some prop models. The safest approach is to assume that any open trade can temporarily move against you and to size accordingly.
      </p>

      <h3>End-of-Day trailing maximum loss: how to trade around it</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO describes the 1-Step maximum loss as an end-of-day trailing model. This encourages protecting gains: if you build a cushion, you want to avoid giving it back in a single aggressive session. A practical adaptation is to reduce risk after a strong day and trade “smaller but cleaner” until you stabilize the equity curve.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your strategy naturally has streaky results, consider adding constraints during evaluation: fewer trades per day, no “double sizing,” and reducing exposure during high-volatility events.
      </p>

      <h3>Best Day Rule (50%): practical scenarios</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO defines the Best Day as the single day with the highest closed profit. If that best day becomes more than half of your total profit, FTMO states it is not a rule breach. Instead you continue trading until total profit increases enough so the best day share drops to the allowed threshold.
      </p>
      <p>
        That means a “big first day” can actually create extra work. If you hit a large win early, the best approach is often to trade smaller afterwards and aim for several modest green days rather than trying to repeat another huge day.
      </p>

      <h3>Who should consider 1-Step (and who should avoid it)</h3>
      <p>
        1-Step is a strong fit if you already trade with low drawdowns, you can accept strict daily discipline, and you prefer a simpler evaluation pathway. It can be a weaker fit if your results depend on high leverage, wide stops, or frequent counter-trend attempts where drawdowns are part of the method.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re unsure, test your strategy on a demo with a strict daily loss cap and see how your behaviour changes. Many traders discover that their method is fine — but their execution under pressure isn’t.

      <!-- ===================== YOUR ORIGINAL CONTENT (UNCHANGED) ===================== -->
      <h2 id="ftmo-intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO is one of the most popular modern prop trading firms, known for its evaluation process that lets traders prove their skills and access larger funded accounts.
        In this FTMO review 2025, the goal is to explain how the FTMO Challenge works, what rules you must follow and whether the program fits your trading style and risk tolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of risking only your own capital, you trade an FTMO account under strict risk management rules, and if you pass the evaluation you can become a funded trader with profit share payouts.
        This model has attracted thousands of FTMO traders worldwide who want to scale up without depositing large sums into a personal trading account.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ftmo-how">What Is FTMO and How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO is a prop trading firm that offers traders the chance to manage company capital after completing a two-step evaluation process.
        You start on a demo account during the FTMO Challenge phase, where you must hit a profit target while staying within daily loss and overall loss limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you pass the FTMO Challenge, you move to the Verification phase with a lower profit target but the same focus on consistent risk management.
        Traders who successfully complete both steps can qualify for live funded accounts, where they trade with firm capital and receive a profit share from their results.
      </p>
      <p>
        For many traders, FTMO acts as a bridge between trading a small personal account and handling a much larger balance under professional conditions.
        You pay a one-time fee to enter the evaluation and, if you pass, you can trade an FTMO account many times larger than what you might comfortably deposit on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        This structure aligns incentives: FTMO looks for traders who can follow rules and protect capital, while traders get access to funded accounts and a profit share without taking on full downside risk.
        It is still real trading with real consequences for bad risk management, but without the psychological pressure of losing your own savings.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ftmo-rules">FTMO Challenge, Profit Target &amp; Loss Limits</h2>
      <p>
        The FTMO Challenge is the first step of the evaluation process where you trade a demo account under real market conditions.
        Your goal is to reach a predefined profit target within a set number of trading days while respecting strict daily loss and overall loss limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The daily loss rule prevents you from losing more than a fixed percentage of the FTMO account in a single day, which forces disciplined risk management.
        The maximum loss limit ensures that even over multiple days you cannot allow large drawdowns, rewarding traders who keep position sizes and stop-loss levels under control.
      </p>
      <p>
        To pass FTMO challenges consistently, traders usually focus on building a trading style that emphasizes stable execution over home-run trades.
        Following a clear plan, avoiding emotional revenge trading and respecting the loss limits on every position are critical if you want to progress to a funded account.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ftmo-platforms">Platforms, FTMO Accounts &amp; Trading Style Flexibility</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO accounts can be traded on popular platforms such as MT5, cTrader and DXtrade, giving you a familiar environment if you already use these tools.
        You can choose different account sizes and a standard account structure that matches how much capital you want to eventually manage if you become a funded trader.
      </p>
      <p>
        The firm allows a variety of trading styles as long as you respect the rules, so day traders, swing traders and even some news traders can find a way to fit their approach into the framework.
        This flexibility is one reason many traders view FTMO as a modern prop trading alternative to traditional proprietary trading desks.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of FTMO Accounts &amp; Profit Share</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO offers different starting account sizes so traders can choose an evaluation that matches their ambitions and comfort level.
        Larger accounts usually come with higher potential payouts, but the daily loss and overall loss limits are also expressed as bigger monetary values, which can test your discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you become a funded trader, you receive a profit share from the gains generated on your FTMO accounts, while the firm absorbs trading losses within the agreed limits.
        This means your primary job is to protect equity, stay within the rules and steadily grow the account rather than chase oversized returns in a short time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, consistently profitable FTMO traders may qualify for account scaling, where the size of their funded accounts can increase if they meet performance criteria.
        This creates a pathway where disciplined traders can gradually manage more capital without taking on additional personal financial risk.
      </p>

      <h2>Educational Tools, Performance Coaches &amp; Risk Management</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond funding, FTMO supports traders with educational tools, statistics dashboards and performance coaches who help you understand strengths and weaknesses in your approach.
        You can review detailed metrics on your trades, including average win and loss, drawdown and preferred trading hours, which makes it easier to refine risk management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access to performance coaches is particularly valuable for traders who struggle with psychology, discipline or adapting their trading style to the firm’s rules.
        By combining structured feedback with clear loss limits, FTMO encourages traders to build habits that are sustainable over the long term, not just during the evaluation process.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ftmo-proscons">Pros &amp; Cons of FTMO in 2025</h2>
      <p>
        As a prop trading firm, FTMO offers the opportunity to trade larger funded accounts without putting all your own capital at risk, which is a major advantage for skilled but undercapitalized traders.
        The transparent rules around daily loss, profit target and maximum drawdown also make it clear what is expected before you start the evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, some traders find the strict loss limits stressful, especially if their natural trading style involves higher volatility or larger swings.
        Passing the FTMO Challenge requires consistency and emotional control, so it may not be suitable for traders who have not yet developed a robust risk management framework.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ftmo-pass">How to Increase Your Chances to Pass the FTMO Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The traders who pass FTMO challenges most often are usually those who treat the evaluation like a professional job rather than a quick gamble.
        They start with a clearly defined trading style, stick to a written plan and size positions so that even a string of losing trades will not violate the daily loss or maximum loss limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many successful candidates take time to practice on a personal demo account before paying for the evaluation, using this phase to refine entries, exits and risk per trade.
        By the time they start the FTMO Challenge, they already know their typical drawdown, win rate and average trade, which makes it easier to stay calm during inevitable losing streaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another useful approach is to focus on quality over quantity by taking fewer, higher-probability trades instead of trying to hit the profit target through overtrading.
        Combining conservative position sizing with patience can make it more realistic to reach the profit target while staying comfortably inside the daily loss boundaries.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts: Who Should Try FTMO in 2025?</h2>
      <p>
        FTMO is best suited to disciplined traders who already have a tested strategy and want to scale up through funded accounts rather than trading only personal capital.
        If you are comfortable working within defined loss limits, tracking performance and adjusting your trading style to fit clear rules, the FTMO Challenge can be a realistic path to becoming a funded trader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traders who are still experimenting or rely heavily on impulsive decisions may struggle with the evaluation process and should first focus on developing consistency on their own demo account.
        For serious and methodical FTMO traders, however, this modern prop trading model can offer a structured way to access more capital and share in the profits of successful trading.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, FTMO is not a shortcut to easy money but a structured way to prove that you can trade responsibly under clear rules.
        If you already have a solid edge and are willing to treat the evaluation process with the same seriousness as a professional trading job, FTMO in 2025 can be a worthwhile opportunity to access institutional-sized capital.

      <h2 id="ftmo-faq">FTMO FAQ 2026</h2>

      <h3>What is the FTMO Challenge: 1-Step?</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO Challenge: 1-Step is a single-phase evaluation format with objectives that include a profit target, a daily loss limit, a maximum loss model with end-of-day trailing, and a Best Day consistency objective. If you’re planning to buy it, confirm the latest objectives on FTMO’s official pages.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the Best Day Rule and what happens if I don’t meet it?</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO defines the Best Day as the single day with the highest profit calculated from closed trades. FTMO states that not meeting the Best Day threshold is not treated as a breach; you can continue trading until total profit increases enough so the Best Day share drops to the allowed level.
      </p>

      <h3>How much capital can I manage with FTMO in 2026?</h3>
      <p>
        FTMO evaluation accounts typically range up to $200,000 for a single account, with the possibility of scaling and combining accounts over time if you trade consistently and respect the rules. Exact sizes and configurations can change, so it is always best to check the latest options on the official FTMO website.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I fail FTMO even if I am profitable?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. It is possible to end the period in overall profit but still fail because you breached the maximum daily loss or total loss limits at some point.
      </p>
