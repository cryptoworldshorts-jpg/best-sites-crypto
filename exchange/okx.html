    <h2>What Is OKX Exchange?</h2>
    <p>
      OKX is one of the largest and most trusted <a href="/crypto-exchange-list.html" style="color:#00eaff;">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> in the world. Launched in 2017, the exchange quickly grew into a global leader thanks to its deep liquidity, low trading fees, advanced futures market, and industry-leading security architecture. 
      With more than 20 million users worldwide in 2025, OKX has become a top choice for both beginners and professional traders.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform offers spot trading, futures, options, staking, crypto earn products, copy trading, bot trading, DeFi access, and a multi-chain Web3 wallet. Its ecosystem is designed so that even a new trader can understand the basics, while advanced users have access to highly professional tools similar to institutional trading platforms.
    </p>

    <h2>OKX Key Features</h2>
    <p>
      The main reason OKX stands out among exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Bitget, and Kucoin is its unique combination of low fees, deep liquidity, and strong security. Whether someone wants to trade Bitcoin, altcoins, futures with leverage, or automate crypto strategies, OKX provides a complete trading environment in one place.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Spot Trading</h3>
    <p>
      The OKX spot market supports over 350 trading pairs with extremely tight spreads. The trading interface includes TradingView charts, technical indicators, multiple timeframes, and advanced order types like OCO, trailing stop, iceberg orders, and TWAP. Beginners can also use the simplified buy/sell crypto panel for easy purchases.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Futures & Derivatives</h3>
    <p>
      OKX is best known for its futures platform, which is considered one of the strongest and most liquid globally. Perpetual futures, quarterly futures, and margin trading are available with leverage up to 125x. Deep liquidity ensures minimal slippage even during major price moves — a major advantage for day traders, scalpers, and high-frequency strategies.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Copy Trading</h3>
    <p>
      Copy trading on OKX allows beginners to automatically follow top-performing traders. This is ideal for users who want passive income or want to learn from real professionals. Traders can see performance stats, risk levels, drawdown, and win rates before copying.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Trading Bots</h3>
    <p>
      OKX offers built-in automated trading bots including grid bots, DCA bots, recurring buy bots, arbitrage bots and AI-recommended strategies. These tools allow users to automate short-term and long-term strategies without programming skills.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Security & Proof-of-Reserves</h3>
    <p>
      Security is one of the biggest strengths of OKX. The exchange stores most user funds in cold storage, uses multi-signature wallets, and provides 24/7 monitoring systems. OKX also publishes monthly Proof-of-Reserves audits, proving that all user assets are backed 1:1.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Staking & Passive Income</h3>
    <p>
      OKX Earn offers flexible and fixed savings products for dozens of cryptocurrencies. Users can stake coins, earn yield, provide liquidity, or participate in launchpools. Many assets offer higher APYs than competing exchanges.
    </p>

    <h2>Trading Fees on OKX</h2>
    <p>
      One of the main reasons traders choose OKX is its extremely low fee structure. Spot fees start at only <strong>0.08% maker / 0.10% taker</strong>, and futures fees can drop as low as 0.02% based on volume or OKB token holdings. This makes OKX an excellent choice for high-volume traders. For more details on fees, check our <a href="/fees/okx-fees.html" style="color:#00eaff;">OKX fees page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Mobile App</h2>
    <p>
      The OKX mobile app is one of the highest rated in the crypto industry. Traders can open futures, spot trades, copy trades, and manage funds with a smooth interface. The app is optimized for both iOS and Android and includes biometric login, alerts, and full charting tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Why OKX Is a Top Exchange in 2025</h2>
    <p>
      With its combination of security, low fees, deep liquidity, and constant innovation, OKX remains one of the strongest exchanges in 2025. It is trusted by beginners, day traders, scalpers, and long-term investors alike. The platform’s stability and transparency make it a long-term industry leader.
