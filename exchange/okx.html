      trading, staking, low fees, and strong security infrastructure. Founded in 2017, OKX has grown into a global trading
      platform used by millions of traders thanks to its reliability, deep liquidity, and innovative features. Whether you're a
      beginner buying your first crypto or an advanced futures trader seeking low fees and high leverage, OKX provides one of the
      strongest ecosystems in 2025.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Features</h2>
    <p>
      The exchange offers spot trading, futures, options, staking, crypto bots, copy trading, DeFi services, and its own
      multi-chain wallet. OKX also has extremely competitive fees, making it appealing for daily volume traders and scalpers. With
      powerful liquidity and stable infrastructure, the platform allows trades to execute with minimal slippage, even during high
      volatility.
    </p>

    <h3>Spot Trading</h3>
    <p>
      Spot trading on OKX offers access to hundreds of assets, fast execution, and tight spreads. Beginners can easily swap crypto
      using the simple buy/sell interface, while advanced users can use charts, indicators, and order types like limit, market,
      stop-limit, iceberg orders, and OCO.
    </p>

    <h3>Futures & Derivatives</h3>
    <p>
      One of OKX’s strongest advantages is its futures platform, considered among the most liquid in the world. Traders can access
      perpetual futures, quarterly futures, and margin trading with leverage up to 125x. The low funding fees and extremely deep
      liquidity make OKX a top choice for scalpers, swing traders, and algorithmic strategies.
    </p>
