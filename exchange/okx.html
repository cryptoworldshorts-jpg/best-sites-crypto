    <h2>OKX Exchange FAQ 2025</h2>

    <h3>Is OKX available and legal in my country?</h3>
    <p>
      OKX holds MiCA pre‑authorization for operation across the European Economic Area and follows KYC/AML rules in supported regions. Availability still depends on local regulations in your specific country, so it is always best to check the latest regional restrictions and terms directly on the official OKX website before opening an account.
    </p>

    <h3>Is OKX safe for beginners to use?</h3>
    <p>
      OKX is designed for both beginners and advanced traders, with two‑factor authentication (2FA), anti‑phishing codes and extensive cold storage helping to protect accounts and funds. New users should still start slowly, enable all security options, and avoid using margin or futures until they understand the risks.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the main fees on OKX in 2025?</h3>
    <p>
      OKX uses a tiered maker‑taker fee model for spot and derivatives, with very competitive base fees that can be further reduced by holding OKB or reaching higher volume tiers. Deposits in crypto are typically free, while withdrawals incur only network or method‑specific fees that are clearly shown before you confirm the transaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I buy crypto with a bank card or bank transfer on OKX?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, OKX supports multiple fiat deposit methods including credit/debit cards, bank transfers such as SEPA and SWIFT, and third‑party payment providers in many regions. Exact options, limits and fees depend on your country and currency, but the deposit screen always shows the available methods and estimated costs.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the difference between spot, margin and futures trading on OKX?</h3>
    <p>
      Spot trading means buying and selling crypto directly and owning the assets outright, while margin and futures trading use leverage to control larger positions than your cash balance. Margin and futures can amplify both profits and losses, so they are generally recommended only for experienced traders who understand liquidation risk and OKX’s margin rules.
    </p>

    <h3>How does OKX Copy Trading work?</h3>
    <p>
      OKX Copy Trading lets you automatically mirror the trades of selected strategy leaders, with full transparency on their past performance, risk scores and trading style. You can set maximum allocation, stop‑loss limits and other controls so that copy trades match your own risk tolerance instead of blindly following every position.
    </p>

    <h3>What security measures does OKX use to protect funds?</h3>
    <p>
      OKX stores most customer assets in cold wallets, uses multi‑factor authentication, withdrawal whitelists and anti‑phishing codes, and runs real‑time risk monitoring on the platform. In addition, Proof‑of‑Reserves reports and regulatory compliance frameworks help confirm that client assets are properly backed and managed.
