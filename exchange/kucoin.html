  <h2>What Is KuCoin?</h2>
  <p>
    KuCoin, often called the “People’s Exchange,” is one of the largest and most trusted cryptocurrency trading platforms in the world.
    Launched in 2017, KuCoin quickly gained global popularity thanks to its low fees, excellent coin selection, strong futures trading
    platform, automated trading bots, and highly secure trading infrastructure. In 2025, KuCoin is used by more than 29 million traders
    worldwide and supports hundreds of cryptocurrencies with deep liquidity and advanced tools for both beginners and professionals.
  </p>

  <h2>Main Features</h2>
  <p>
    KuCoin offers everything from spot trading and futures to passive-income features like staking, lending, bots, dual investments, and
    KuCoin Earn. The platform supports over 700+ assets, making it one of the most diverse exchanges for altcoins and new listings.
  </p>

  <h3>Spot Trading</h3>
  <p>
    KuCoin’s spot trading interface is simple enough for beginners but powerful enough for experienced traders. It supports market,
    limit, stop-limit, OCO, iceberg, and algorithmic orders. The liquidity is strong across major pairs such as BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT,
    and hundreds of altcoins that smaller exchanges cannot support.
  </p>

  <h3>Futures Trading</h3>
  <p>
    KuCoin Futures is one of the most traded derivatives platforms in the world. It supports perpetual and delivery futures with leverage
    up to 125x. The low fees and deep liquidity make it attractive for scalpers and day traders. Futures fees on KuCoin start at
    0.02% maker / 0.06% taker but can be significantly reduced using the native KCS token.
  </p>

  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>
    KuCoin uses multi-layered security systems with cold storage, anti-phishing codes, two-factor authentication, withdrawal
    whitelists, and constant risk monitoring. The exchange also provides real-time Proof-of-Reserves, allowing users to independently
    verify that KuCoin holds customer assets safely and transparently.
  </p>

  <h3>Trading Bots</h3>
  <p>
    One of KuCoin’s biggest advantages is its built-in trading bots. The platform offers DCA bots, grid bots, Martingale bots, spot-futures
    arbitrage bots, and infinity grid bots. Beginners can automate their strategy, while advanced traders can build and customize
    bots for long-term passive income.
  </p>

  <h3>Fees</h3>
  <p>
    KuCoin is famous for having some of the lowest fees in the industry. Spot trading fees begin at 0.1% and can be reduced by holding
    or staking the KuCoin Token (KCS). Futures fees are even lower, making KuCoin one of the most cost-efficient exchanges for frequent
    traders.
  </p>

  <h3>KuCoin Token (KCS)</h3>
  <p>
    KCS is the native token of KuCoin and offers fee discounts, daily rewards, staking benefits, and access to exclusive trading
    features. Traders who hold KCS receive a portion of daily trading fee revenue generated by the exchange, making it one of the most
    rewarding exchange tokens in 2025.
  </p>

  <h2>Why KuCoin Is a Top Exchange in 2025</h2>
  <p>
    KuCoin continues to dominate the global crypto market due to its fast execution, low fees, excellent support for altcoins, and
    advanced trading tools. The exchange is ideal for both beginners who want a simple way to buy crypto and professionals who rely on
    deep liquidity and high-performance futures markets.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2025, KuCoin remains one of the most complete crypto trading platforms — offering high security, passive income options, and an
    advanced trading ecosystem suitable for every level of experience.
