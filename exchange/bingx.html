      and experienced traders.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Features of BingX</h2>
    <p>
      The platform offers spot trading, futures trading, copy trading, crypto bots, grid trading, staking, savings, 
      demo trading, and a futures simulator. BingX is known for its educational tools, simple layout, and transparent fee 
      structure. Even complete beginners can use the exchange without confusion. The biggest highlight is the advanced 
      copy trading system, which allows users to follow professional traders and automatically mirror their trades.
    </p>

    <h3>Copy Trading</h3>
    <p>
      Copy trading is where BingX truly dominates the market. Unlike traditional exchanges, BingX allows users to browse 
      thousands of verified traders, view their performance history, win rate, risk level, and current profitability. 
      With one click, beginners can copy these traders and have all trades executed automatically. This system offers one of 
      the easiest ways to enter crypto futures trading without needing expert skills. Many users treat copy trading as a 
      passive income stream.
    </p>

    <h3>Futures Trading</h3>
    <p>
      BingX offers strong and fast futures trading with high liquidity, tight spreads, and leverage up to 150x depending on 
      the trading pair. Perpetual futures are available for major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and many 
      altcoins. Risk control tools such as stop-loss, take-profit, isolated margin, and cross margin are clearly displayed and 
      beginner-friendly.
    </p>

    <h3>Spot Trading</h3>
    <p>
      The spot market supports hundreds of cryptocurrencies with fast execution and low fees. Users can trade with 
      limit, market, trigger orders, or use automated tools like grid trading bots. Beginners appreciate the clean interface, 
      while advanced traders value the TradingView charts and technical analysis tools.
    </p>

    <h3>Trading Bots</h3>
    <p>
      BingX provides several types of automated trading bots, including grid bots, DCA bots, and futures bots. These allow 
      users to trade automatically based on predefined strategies. The platform also includes a demo mode, making it easy to 
      test and optimize bots without using real money.
    </p>

    <h3>Security & Reliability</h3>
    <p>
      In 2025, BingX is regarded as a highly secure exchange with multi-layer protection including cold storage, 
      anti-phishing tools, two-factor authentication (2FA), withdrawal whitelist, and real-time risk monitoring. The 
      exchange has an excellent reputation with zero major hacks since launch.
    </p>

    <h3>Fees</h3>
    <p>
      BingX offers competitive trading fees. Spot trading fees start at 0.10%, while futures fees are lower and vary 
      depending on volume. Users who hold the platform's token or trade higher volume receive fee discounts. BingX is widely 
      considered one of the cheaper platforms for daily trading and scalping.
    </p>
